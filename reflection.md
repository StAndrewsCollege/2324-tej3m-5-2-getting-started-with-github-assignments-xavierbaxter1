# Challenging Part of the Test

One aspect of the test I found was particulairly challenging, was the first question where I had to look at the picture, and draw the wires to where it connects to, the reason why I found this difficult was because in the image it never got power, however every circuit needs power to work, unless the power came from the other usb connection.
